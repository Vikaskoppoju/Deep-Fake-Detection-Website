# Deepfake Detection Website 🎭

A Django-based web application for detecting **deepfake videos** using a hybrid **CNN + LSTM** deep learning model.  
The system extracts frames from uploaded videos, processes them with a CNN to capture spatial features, and leverages an LSTM to model temporal dependencies for accurate detection.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a video through a simple web interface.
- Preprocessing pipeline to extract frames from video.
- CNN extracts spatial (frame-level) features.
- LSTM models temporal sequence patterns.
- Returns **deepfake probability** and detection result.
- Django-powered website with clean UI.
